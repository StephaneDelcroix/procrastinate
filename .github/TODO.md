# Things to do in this app:

## UI
- minigames: game icon not vertically aligned with text
- when navigating tabs, settings page should close, if it's open
- theme isn't applied on already created pages. use {DynamicResource}
- mini-games views should leverage XAML
- all pages: if there's no scrolling, top-align (not center)
- simon mini-game: make the button square (they're rectangle) with a small gutter
- generated excuses aren't zalgo if zalgo setting is picked
- Tab label (at bottom) aren't zalgo, if zalgo is set
- popup shown on 'add more task' isn't zalgo, if zalgo is set
