# Things to do in this app:

## BUGS
- ~~crash on navigating after opening the settings page~~

## UI
- ~~minigames: game icon not vertically aligned with text~~
- ~~when navigating tabs, settings page should close, if it's open~~
- ~~theme isn't applied on already created pages. use {DynamicResource}~~
- ~~mini-games views should leverage XAML~~
- ~~all pages: if there's no scrolling, top-align (not center)~~
- ~~simon mini-game: make the button square (they're rectangle) with a small gutter~~
- ~~generated excuses aren't zalgo if zalgo setting is picked~~
- ~~Tab label (at bottom) aren't zalgo, if zalgo is set~~
- ~~popup shown on 'add more task' isn't zalgo, if zalgo is set~~
- ~~in settings page: icons and title (like accessibility) aren't vertically aligned~~
- ~~settings still doesn't close on changing tab~~

## Games
- add a game like "game & Watch" "mickey mouse" (aka eggs) game
- add a game that randomly creates a LEGO minifigure
- clickspeed: ScoreLabel should use a binding to update, without a trigger from code. same for most games using UpdateXXX methods to update labels
